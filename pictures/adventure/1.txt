There's this cat that occasionally visits us outside in our front yard and meows sweetly as it approaches close. She was hungry and lonely, seeking a home to be cared for. We didn't hesitate to go out and buy food for her as she continue to show trust and love toward our hospitality. For awhile she didn't respond to us when we tried to name her until one day she came to us with a name she liked. So her name is Bobby. Coincidentally we named one of our new cats Bobby also!
